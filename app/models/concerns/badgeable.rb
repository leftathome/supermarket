module Badgeable
  # The list of badges.
  # It would be a phenomenally bad idea to reorder this array's elements.
  # Logic about whether a badge is in the badges_mask is based on the index
  # of the badge text in this array. If you change the order--and therefore the
  # index--the integers stored in the database for a record's badges_mask will
  # no longer match the badges that the record was assigned.

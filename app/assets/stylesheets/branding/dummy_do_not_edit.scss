// A placeholder file to allow for sass-globbing of overrides.
//
// sass-globbing requires at least one file to
// be present in the globbed directory.  Without
// this file, the "@import *" line in common.scss fails.
//
// Do not edit this file; instead, place your own
// overrides in another .scss file in this directory.
// This directory is not version tracked, so be sure to
// store your overrides separately.

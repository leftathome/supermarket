      <h3>The Chef Community Cookbooks Survey</h3>
      <p>
        We would love to know more about what you think about community cookbooks and are runnning a quick survey.  This will help us understand the role they play in your use of Chef. As a community member, you are invited to participate. You have a unique understanding of the role community cookbooks have in your work, and we value your opinion. Most people take about 5 minutes to complete this survey. There are no right or wrong answers; we are interested in your opinions.

      <h3>Supermarket Belongs to the Community</h3>

      <p>Supermarket belongs to the community. While Chef has the responsibility to keep it running and be stewards of its functionality, what it does and how it works is driven by the community. The <a href="https://github.com/chef/supermarket">chef/supermarket</a> repository will continue to be where development of the Supermarket application takes place. Come be part of shaping the direction of Supermarket by opening issues and pull requests or by joining us on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chef-supermarket">supermarket mailing list</a> or in <a href="https://gitter.im/chef/supermarket">Gitter</a>.</p>
